This is an example Clojure web application written using the Duct
framework. This code is referenced by my blog on [Building a Clojure
web application using Duct](https://circleci.com/blog/build-a-clojure-web-app-using-duct/).

## Developing

### Setup

When you first clone this repository, cd into the cloned directory and run:

```sh
lein duct setup
```

This will create files for local configuration, and prep your system
for the project.

Note: You will need to create an empty db/ directory under the project
directory.

``` sh
mkdir db
```

### Environment

To begin developing, start with a REPL.

```sh
lein repl
```

Then load the development environment.

```clojure
user=> (dev)
:loaded
```

Run `go` to prep and initiate the system.

```clojure
dev=> (go)
:duct.server.http.jetty/starting-server {:port 3000}
:initiated
```

By default this creates a web server at <http://localhost:3000>.

When you make changes to your source files, use `reset` to reload any
modified files and reset the server.

```clojure
dev=> (reset)
:reloading (...)
:resumed
```

### Testing

Testing is fastest through the REPL, as you avoid environment startup
time.

```clojure
dev=> (test)
...
```

But you can also run tests through Leiningen.

```sh
lein test
```
